  			<p>07 April 2022</p>
  				<p>Java EE 8, nowadays known as Jakarta EE 8, added a new Security API in version 1.0 to the technology stack. This little series of articles takes a look at the new API and how it can be used with various application servers, starting in the first part with Payara (Glassfish).</p>

  				<p>Container images can be built in many ways, utilizing different tools. For Java developers a Java-only solution might be appealing. One of the more popular options in this area is jib, the Java Image Build tool from Google. In this Post we'll have at the look on how it can be used to package an MicroProfile application as container image.</p>

  				<p>Web applications often serve static content alongside with dynamically generated HTML pages. If the static content is not hosted on a CDN, the application server should provide this kind of content, too.

  			<p>22 February 2021</p>
  				<p>Jakarta EE standards do not support HTTP multipart messages very well. This may be the reason that multipart endpoints are rarely seen in REST APIs. However, sometimes we find the multipart/form-data content type used to upload files. This Blog demonstrates an approach on how such endpoints can be utilized by standard JAXRS Clients.</p>

  				<p>The JBoss/Wildfly ecosystem is very rich and popular in enterprise computing. But targeting cloud platforms the application server approach is not appropriate. Single (FAT) JAR packaging is much more common for containerized deployments. After the end of Thorntail the Wildfly project offers with "Wildfly Bootable JAR" a new deployment option of this kind.</p>

  				<p>Developing Cloud-native environments fosters the trend to a new kind of development environments, which are also hosted in the cloud. Beside Github's Codespaces, Eclipse Che is one of the players at this ground. To get a first impression of the new type of IDE, I tried Eclipse Theia locally using the project's pre-defined Docker image. In doing so, I learned something interesting about sharing files with containers.</p>

  			<p>19 April 2020</p>
  				<p>Validation of input data is a crucial requirement for any serious application. This also applies to REST services implemented with JAX/RS. If you follow a Design-First development approach with Swagger/OpenAPI, server stubs and model objects are usually generated. The generated code of API's model classes already contain JSR 380 annotations, which trigger validation of received request objects by the Bean Validation 2.0 framework. This article is about application-specific extension of validation rules for generated model classes.</p>

  				<p>Implementing JAX/RS REST APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI, the language agnostic interface to RESTful APIs, following an API Design-First approach starts with the formal specification of the REST API. Then OpenAPI generators are used to create server stubs. These code generators create specific problems, that may require customization of templates or the whole generator.

  				<p>Implementing JAX/RS REST APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI following a Design-First approach starts with the formal specification of the REST API. Then OpenAPI generators are used to create server as well as client stubs. Nowadays, the REST APIs often exchange JSON response and request objects. If binary fields are part of such JSON structures, the generated code encodes/decodes such binary fields. For some combinations of generators the produced client and server do not fit together.</p>
